Updated Prompt for Creating Infographics with Vite + Express:
Prompt:
"Design an interactive infographic that visually highlights the shortcomings of traditional security systems. The infographic should include abstract representations of key issues such as high costs, inefficiency, slow response times, and human error. The design should incorporate modern web technologies, with a dark background and electric green accents to match the website's overall aesthetic. The following tools and elements should be considered to create the infographic:

Data Representation: Use clear, concise labels and descriptions for each issue. These descriptions should be short but impactful, focusing on the core problem (e.g., 'High Costs', 'Slow Response Times').

Icons & Visual Elements: Choose icons or simple illustrations to represent each issue (e.g., a dollar sign for high costs, a clock for slow response times, a tired figure for human error). Keep these visuals sleek and professional.

Interactive Elements: Consider adding interactivity, such as hover effects or tooltips, to display more details about each issue when users interact with the infographic.

Typography & Layout: Use modern, readable fonts with a hierarchy that emphasizes key points (e.g., problem headings in larger text and descriptions in smaller text). Ensure that the layout is clean and easy to follow, with enough space between sections to avoid visual clutter.

JavaScript Libraries:

D3.js: For creating data-driven visualizations and interactive elements, such as animated transitions or data filtering.

Chart.js: If data visualization such as cost comparisons or response time metrics is needed, use this library for smooth, interactive charts.

Canvas API: For custom, hand-drawn elements like lines, shapes, and text. This could be used for creating unique visual styles.

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): Ideal for vector-based graphics that remain sharp at any resolution. Use it for icons, shapes, and scalable charts.

CSS Transitions/Animations: For adding subtle animations to the infographic elements, enhancing the user experience.

Color Scheme & Branding: Ensure the infographic matches the brand's dark theme, with electric green accents. The green should be used sparingly to highlight key points, with white or light gray text for readability.

**The goal is to create an engaging, visually appealing infographic that explains traditional security shortcomings in a simple yet impactful way. The design should be consistent with modern web standards and seamlessly integrate into the overall website."

Conclusion:
This approach will allow you to use JavaScript-based libraries and tools to generate dynamic, interactive graphics directly in the user's browser, offering better performance, smoother integration with your website, and a more engaging user experience.
