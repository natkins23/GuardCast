Prompt:
"Create an animated progress circle that visually fills when hovered over, starting from 0% and gradually progressing to the target percentage (e.g., 85%) in 1 second. The key focus should be on a smooth, dynamic animation where the circle gradually fills, simulating a progress bar animation, and not showing the final percentage immediately.

Instructions:
Circle Setup (SVG or Canvas):

Use SVG to create a circle representing the progress indicator.

Separate the circle into two parts: one for the background (static) and one for the foreground (animated). The animated part will represent the progress fill.

Styling:

The background of the circle should be dark (e.g., black or dark gray), while the progress part should be filled with an electric green stroke.

Ensure that the progress animation (the green part) gradually fills the circle as the user hovers over the section. It should take 1 second to go from 0% to the target percentage (e.g., 85%).

The circle stroke should have a stroke-dasharray to represent the total circumference and a stroke-dashoffset for the actual fill (progress) to animate.

Animation Mechanics:

Target value: On hover, the circle should animate from 0% to the target value (e.g., 85%) in 1 second. This will happen by manipulating the stroke-dashoffset property.

Smooth Transition: The fill should be a smooth, gradual animation, not an instant fill. Use CSS transitions (or JavaScript) to animate the stroke from 0% to the desired target over the course of 1 second.

Reset on Mouse Leave: When the user stops hovering, the circle should either remain at the target percentage or reset back to 0%. This behavior can be configured using event listeners.

Event Handling:

Use JavaScript to trigger the animation when the user hovers over the circle.

Upon hover, the progress circle should smoothly animate the stroke from 0% to the target percentage (e.g., 85%). The progress should be dynamic, with the percentage being determined by the section (e.g., high costs, slow response times).

Optionally, use mouseleave events to either reset the animation to 0% or keep it at the target percentage.

Customization:

The target percentage should be dynamically adjustable. For example, the percentage value could be 85% for 'High Costs', 40% for 'Slow Response Times', etc.

The progress circle should reflect different values for each section and smoothly animate based on the corresponding target percentage.

Objective:
The goal is to create a dynamic and visually engaging progress animation that gradually fills a circular path, providing an interactive hover experience. The animation should start from 0% and reach the target value, making the interaction feel natural and fluid."

Key Concepts:
SVG Circle: Use this for drawing the progress path.

Stroke Properties: Adjust stroke-dasharray and stroke-dashoffset to control the fill and animation.

JavaScript Event Handling: Use mouseenter and mouseleave events to trigger the animation and control the animation state.

CSS Transitions: Apply smooth transitions to the stroke-dashoffset for a fluid animation.

Dynamic Values: Ensure the target percentage is dynamically adjustable for different sections.

Next Steps:
Start with SVG for the circle structure and implement the dynamic percentage.

Apply stroke-dasharray to create the circumference of the circle.

Use stroke-dashoffset for the progress animation, and apply CSS transitions to animate the fill.

Set up event listeners to trigger the animation on hover and decide whether to reset the circle on mouse leave.
